## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (High Impact, Easy Implementation):
1. `suggest-memory-prompts` - Immediate engagement boost
2. `connect-related-memories` - Natural conversation flow
3. `edit-memory` - Essential utility function

### Phase 2 (Medium Impact, Moderate Complexity):
4. `analyze-memory-gaps` - Proactive discovery
5. `memory-statistics` - Gamification and insights
6. `set-memory-reminders` - Future memory capture

### Phase 3 (High Impact, Complex Implementation):
7. `create-memory-story` - Advanced narrative generation
8. `suggest-chapter-organization` - Intelligent organization
9. `find-memory-themes` - Deep pattern analysis

---

## Integration Notes

- All tools should include `userId` parameter for proper user context
- Implement rate limiting to prevent overuse of AI-intensive tools
- Consider caching for frequently accessed data (statistics, themes)
- Add fallback responses for when tools return no results
- Ensure tools work well together in conversation flow

This enhanced toolkit will transform Maya from a simple recorder into an intelligent memory companion that actively helps users discover, organize, and engage with their life story.
