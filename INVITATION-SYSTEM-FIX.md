# Invitation System Fix - Automatic Chapter Access

## Problem
When users were invited to join the platform via email or SMS, they received messages mentioning specific chapters they'd have access to, but after signing up, they **didn't automatically get access** to those chapters. This was confusing because:

1. The invitation email/SMS mentioned specific chapters
2. But after signup, users had no access to those chapters
3. This was especially problematic for SMS invites where there's no clickable link with tokens

## Solution
Created a **database-tracked invitation system** that works regardless of invitation method (email, SMS, or both).

### How It Works

1. **When an invitation is sent** (`/api/network/invite`):
   - A record is created in the `pending_invitations` table
   - Stores: invitee email/phone, invited chapters, inviter, message, etc.
   - Status: `pending`

2. **When a user signs up** (`/app/auth/register` or `/app/auth/callback`):
   - After account creation, automatically checks for pending invitations
   - Matches by email OR phone number (works for SMS invites!)
   - Grants access to all invited chapters
   - Marks invitations as `accepted`
   - Shows success message: "You've been granted access to X chapter(s)"

3. **User gets immediate access**:
   - No need to click special links
   - Works with SMS invitations
   - Works with email invitations
   - Works if they sign up later (invitation remains pending)

## Files Changed

### New Files
1. **`create-invitations-tracking-table.sql`** - Database migration
   - Creates `pending_invitations` table
   - Tracks all invitations with chapter access
   - Indexes for fast lookups by email/phone

2. **`app/api/auth/process-invitation/route.ts`** - New API endpoint
   - Checks for pending invitations on signup
   - Grants chapter access automatically
   - Marks invitations as accepted

### Modified Files
1. **`app/api/network/invite/route.ts`**
   - Now creates invitation record BEFORE sending email/SMS
   - Stores chapter IDs in `pending_invitations` table
   - Works for email, SMS, or both methods

2. **`app/auth/register/page.tsx`**
   - Calls `/api/auth/process-invitation` after signup
   - Shows user how many chapters they got access to
   - Works seamlessly in the background

3. **`app/auth/callback/page.tsx`**
   - Same invitation processing for email confirmations
   - Ensures users get access even if email confirmation is required

## Database Migration

Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- See: create-invitations-tracking-table.sql
```

This creates:
- `pending_invitations` table
- Indexes for email/phone lookups
- Status tracking (pending, accepted, expired, cancelled)
- Automatic expiry after 30 days

## Features

‚úÖ **Works with SMS invitations** - no need for clickable links
‚úÖ **Works with email invitations** - backward compatible
‚úÖ **Matches by email OR phone** - flexible matching
‚úÖ **Automatic access grant** - seamless UX
‚úÖ **Multiple chapter support** - can invite to many chapters at once
‚úÖ **Invitation tracking** - know who accepted when
‚úÖ **Expiry handling** - invitations expire after 30 days
‚úÖ **Idempotent** - won't add duplicate memberships

## Testing

### Test Scenario 1: Email Invitation
1. User A invites User B via email to chapters "College Years" and "Work Life"
2. User B receives email mentioning both chapters
3. User B signs up with that email
4. ‚úÖ User B automatically gets access to both chapters
5. ‚úÖ User B sees: "You've been granted access to 2 chapters"

### Test Scenario 2: SMS Invitation
1. User A invites User C via SMS to chapter "Family"
2. User C receives text message (no link needed)
3. User C signs up using their phone number
4. ‚úÖ User C automatically gets access to "Family" chapter
5. ‚úÖ User C sees: "You've been granted access to 1 chapter"

### Test Scenario 3: Both Methods
1. User A invites User D via both email AND SMS
2. User D receives both messages
3. User D signs up with either email or phone
4. ‚úÖ User D automatically gets access to all invited chapters
5. ‚úÖ Only one invitation record is processed (no duplicates)

## Next Steps

1. **Run the database migration** (see `create-invitations-tracking-table.sql`)
2. **Test the flow**:
   - Send an invitation to yourself
   - Sign up with a new account
   - Verify chapter access is granted automatically
3. **Monitor logs** for `üîç Checking for pending invitations...` messages

## Future Enhancements

- Admin UI to view/manage pending invitations
- Resend invitation functionality
- Manual invitation cancellation
- Notification when someone accepts your invitation
- Analytics on invitation acceptance rates
