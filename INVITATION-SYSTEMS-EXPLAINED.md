# 📬 Invitation Systems - Quick Reference

## 🚨 TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SYSTEMS

### 1️⃣ CHAPTER INVITES (Person Collaboration)
**What:** Invite someone to collaborate on your life chapters  
**Email Button:** "Join This Is Me"  
**Email Contains:** ✅ Invite code (e.g., `K7P2XMNH`)  
**Where to Redeem:** "Shared" tab → Top right → "Have an invite code?" button  
**Success Message:** "Chapters unlocked! Check the 'Life' tab..."  
**Where to Find After Redeeming:** Go to **"Life" tab** - chapters will be mixed with your own  
**What You Can Do:** Add memories to their chapters, edit their content

---

### 2️⃣ MEMORY INVITES (Memory Collaboration)
**What:** Share a specific memory with someone  
**Email Button:** "View Memory & Accept Invitation"  
**Email Contains:** ❌ No code needed  
**Where to Find:** "Shared" → "Shared with you" tab  
**How to Accept:** Click "Accept Invitation" button in the "Pending Invitations" section  
**Where to Find After Accepting:** "Shared" → "Shared with you" tab  
**What You Can Do:** View, comment, and contribute to that specific memory

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### "I redeemed a code but nothing is in Shared with you!"
✅ **This is correct!** Chapter invites appear in the **"Life" tab**, not "Shared".

### "I got an email about a memory but don't see it!"
1. Go to "Shared" → "Shared with you"
2. Check "Pending Invitations" section at the top
3. Click "Accept Invitation"
4. Memory will then appear in "Shared with you" below

### "I can't find the redeem button!"
- Go to **"Shared" tab** (not "My People")
- Look at the **top right corner**
- Click **"Have an invite code?"**
