# 🤖 AI-Powered Self-Healing Support System

## Overview

This AI support system can automatically analyze tickets, generate fixes, and even apply them safely to your codebase. It's designed to handle common issues like the chronological timeline sorting bug you mentioned.

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### Step 1: Database Setup
Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the entire contents of:
-- supabase/migrations/004_ai_support_system.sql
```

### Step 2: Environment Variables
Ensure you have these in your Vercel environment:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_key
```

## 🧠 How It Works

### Phase 1: Intelligent Analysis
When you click "Analyze" on a ticket, the AI:

1. **Reads the ticket** (title, description, category, priority)
2. **Analyzes the problem** using GPT-4o
3. **Identifies likely code locations** that need examination
4. **Determines complexity** and fix difficulty (1-10 scale)
5. **Assesses if it's auto-fixable** (safe patterns vs risky ones)
6. **Suggests approach** and testing strategy

**Example for your chronological sorting issue:**
```json
{
  "ROOT_CAUSE": "Timeline component not sorting memories by date field",
  "CODE_LOCATION": ["components/ChronologicalTimelineView.tsx", "components/TimelineView.tsx"],
  "COMPLEXITY": 3,
  "AUTO_FIXABLE": true,
  "SUGGESTED_APPROACH": "Add .sort() method to memories array based on created_at timestamp"
}
```

### Phase 2: Fix Generation
The AI then:

1. **Reads your actual source code** from the identified files
2. **Generates specific code changes** with exact modifications
3. **Creates a rollback plan** in case something goes wrong
4. **Provides testing instructions** to verify the fix
5. **Calculates confidence score** (0-100%) based on fix completeness

**Example fix output:**
```json
{
  "DIAGNOSIS": "ChronologicalTimelineView.tsx line 45: memories array not sorted by date",
  "CODE_CHANGES": {
    "components/ChronologicalTimelineView.tsx": [
      {
        "type": "replace",
        "find": "const displayMemories = memories.filter(...)",
        "replace": "const displayMemories = memories.filter(...).sort((a, b) => new Date(a.created_at) - new Date(b.created_at))"
      }
    ]
  },
  "FILES_MODIFIED": ["components/ChronologicalTimelineView.tsx"],
  "TESTING_APPROACH": "Verify memories appear in chronological order in timeline view"
}
```

### Phase 3: Safe Application (Optional)
With human approval, the system can:

1. **Create automatic backups** of all files to be modified
2. **Apply the code changes** exactly as specified
3. **Run TypeScript checks** and linting to verify no errors
4. **Automatically rollback** if any tests fail
5. **Update the ticket status** to resolved
6. **Add detailed comments** explaining what was fixed

## 🛡️ Safety Features

### Multiple Safety Layers:
- ✅ **Human review required** for all fixes by default
- ✅ **Automatic backups** before any changes
- ✅ **TypeScript/lint checking** before deployment
- ✅ **Rollback on failure** with one-click restore
- ✅ **Protected file patterns** (can't modify package.json, .env, etc.)
- ✅ **Risk assessment** (low/medium/high) for each fix
- ✅ **Dangerous pattern detection** (prevents rm -rf, DROP TABLE, etc.)

### Auto-Fix Criteria:
Only "safe" patterns are eligible for auto-application:
- ✅ Sorting/display order issues
- ✅ CSS styling fixes  
- ✅ Text/UI changes
- ❌ Database modifications
- ❌ Authentication changes
- ❌ Payment/security code

## 📊 Dashboard Features

### AI Support Dashboard (`/admin/ai-support`)
- **Real-time statistics** (analyses performed, fixes applied, success rates)
- **Ticket analysis interface** with one-click AI insights
- **Fix generation** with confidence scoring
- **Safety status monitoring**
- **System configuration** (auto-fix thresholds, protected files)

### Smart Insights:
- **Pattern recognition** (identifies similar issues across tickets)
- **Complexity scoring** (estimates fix difficulty and time)
- **Risk assessment** (flags potentially dangerous changes)
- **Learning system** (improves over time based on success/failure)

## 🎯 Real-World Example: Your Chronological Sorting Bug

Here's exactly how the AI would handle your timeline sorting issue:

1. **Analysis Phase:**
   ```
   🔍 AI detects: "Timeline not sorting chronologically"
   📍 Identifies: ChronologicalTimelineView.tsx as primary suspect
   ⚡ Complexity: 3/10 (simple sorting fix)
   ✅ Auto-fixable: Yes (safe display logic change)
   ```

2. **Fix Generation:**
   ```typescript
   // AI reads your current code and generates:
   const sortedMemories = memories
     .filter(memory => memory.timezone_id === selectedTimezone?.id)
     .sort((a, b) => new Date(a.created_at).getTime() - new Date(b.created_at).getTime())
   ```

3. **Safe Application:**
   ```
   📦 Backup created: backup_1704067200_abc123
   ✏️ Applied fix to ChronologicalTimelineView.tsx
   ✅ TypeScript check: Passed
   ✅ Lint check: Passed  
   🎯 Ticket #6bc5a933 marked as resolved
   💬 Comment added: "🤖 AI fixed chronological sorting issue"
   ```

## 🔧 Configuration Options

The system includes configurable settings:

```json
{
  "auto_fix_enabled": true,
  "auto_apply_enabled": false,  // Keep disabled for safety
  "max_files_per_fix": 5,
  "required_confidence_score": 80,
  "safe_file_patterns": ["components/**", "pages/**", "styles/**"],
  "protected_files": ["package.json", "next.config.js", ".env*", "prisma/**"]
}
```

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

### Learning System:
- **Pattern recognition** from successful fixes
- **User feedback integration** (thumbs up/down on AI suggestions)
