# VAPI Maya Voice Assistant Debug Report

**ðŸŽ‰ RESOLVED - View Complete Report: [/debug/vapi-maya-report](/debug/vapi-maya-report)**

*This issue has been fully resolved using Railway deployment. The comprehensive debug report with all technical details, solutions, and implementation guides is now available as an interactive webpage.*

## ðŸŽ¯ **SUMMARY**

**Problem:** VAPI Maya couldn't authenticate users due to Vercel middleware blocking external webhook requests.

**Solution:** Deployed webhook service to Railway, bypassing Vercel's authentication restrictions while maintaining identical functionality.

**Result:** Maya now works seamlessly - users can save, search, and organize memories through natural voice conversation.

**Cost:** $0-5/month (Railway free tier vs $150/month Vercel Pro)
